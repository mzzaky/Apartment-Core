## New in v1.2.6
- Fixed Admin Commands: Three admin set commands that previously did not work have now been fixed and are functioning as intended
- Adding the `/apartmentcore admin set rate <id> <value>` command, which allows administrators to manually set or override the average rating of an apartment.
- Introducing a new statistics tracking system for each apartment owned. Data is stored in a new file called `apartments-stats.yml.` Statistics tracked include: (1) Total Taxes Paid,  (2) Total Revenue Generated, (3) Age of Ownership.
- New PlaceholderAPI support: 
  | Placeholder | Description |
  |--------------|-------------|
  | `%apartmentcore_statistic_<id>_total_tax_paid%` | Displays the total tax paid. |
  | `%apartmentcore_statistic_<id>_total_income_generated%` | Displays the total income generated. |
  | `%apartmentcore_statistic_<id>_ownership_age_days%` | Displays the age of ownership in days. |

- Daily Task Optimization: Daily tasks were refactored to handle tax calculations and ownership age additions more efficiently in a single cycle.
- Data Integrity: The new statistical system has been fully integrated into the auto-save cycle and shutdown procedures to ensure no data is lost.
