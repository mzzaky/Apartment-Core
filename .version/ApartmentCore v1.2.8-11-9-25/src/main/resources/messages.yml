# =========================================
# ApartmentCore Messages Configuration
# =========================================
#
# - Supports Minecraft color codes using '&' (e.g., &a, &c, &7, &l, &n).
# - Placeholders like %player%, %amount%, %apartment%, %days% will be replaced at runtime.
# - Edit texts freely. Keep the placeholders intact.
#
# Tips:
# - Use \n to force a line break inside a message when needed.
# - Use &r to reset formatting.
# - You can include Unicode icons if your font supports them (e.g., ⚠, ✅).
